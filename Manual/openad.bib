       abstract = "Algorithmic, or automatic, differentiation (AD) is a growing area of theoretical
         research and software development concerned with the accurate and efficient evaluation of
         derivatives for function evaluations given as computer programs. The resulting derivative values are
         useful for all scientific computations that are based on linear, quadratic, or higher order
         approximations to nonlinear scalar or vector functions.\par AD has been applied in particular
         to optimization, parameter identification, nonlinear equation solving, the numerical integration of
         differential equations, and combinations of these. Apart from quantifying sensitivities numerically,
         AD also yields structural dependence information, such as the sparsity pattern and generic rank of
         Jacobian matrices. The field opens up an exciting opportunity to develop new algorithms that reflect
         the true cost of accurate derivatives and to use them for improvements in speed and
         reliability.\par This second edition has been updated and expanded to cover recent developments
         in applications and theory, including an elegant NP completeness argument by Uwe Naumann and a brief
         introduction to scarcity, a generalization of sparsity. There is also added material on
         checkpointing and iterative differentiation. To improve readability the more detailed analysis of
         memory and complexity bounds has been relegated to separate, optional chapters.The book consists of
         three parts: a stand-alone introduction to the fundamentals of AD and its software; a thorough
         treatment of methods for sparse problems; and final chapters on program-reversal schedules, higher
         derivatives, nonsmooth problems and iterative processes. Each of the 15 chapters concludes with
         examples and exercises.",

       abstract = "The OpenAD/F tool allows the evaluation of derivatives of functions defined by a
         Fortran program. The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the
         analysis and transformation of the original program that defines the function of interest. OpenADF
         has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the use of open source
         components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles of automatic differentiation,
         the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various levels, for example, for basic block
         preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, OpenAD/F
         uses components provided by the OpenAD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of
         the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results
         implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation
         engine is an XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation
         algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences
         of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes,
         OpenAD/F supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine
         level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet
         simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute
         sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such
         as bottom topography as independent (control) variables.",
